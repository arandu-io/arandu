# Contributing

## Sign your commits

Every commit needs a `Signed-off-by` line:

```
git commit -s -m "what changed and why"
```

That line is the [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/):
you are stating that you wrote the change, or that you have the right to submit
it under this project's license. It is not a copyright assignment — you keep
your copyright, and this project can never be relicensed behind your back.

We use DCO rather than a CLA on purpose. A CLA would let the project relicense
later, and the price is that every contributor has to sign a legal document
before their first patch.

## Before you open a pull request

```
gofmt -l .        # no output
go vet ./...
go test -race ./...
```

CI runs exactly this, plus a check that no new dependency entered the core: the
framework depends on the standard library and `golang.org/x/crypto`, and nothing
else. A pull request that adds a dependency there needs to argue for it first,
in an issue.

## What the commit message says

What changed and why. The why is the part that is not in the diff, and it is the
part someone will need in two years.

No AI attribution of any kind: no `Co-Authored-By` for an assistant, no
"generated with" footer. Commits are authored by the people who submit them.

## Architecture decisions

The decisions this project has already made live in `arandu-io/docs`, and every
one that closed a door has an ADR. If your change contradicts one, say so in the
pull request and argue for the change of decision — that is a normal thing to
do, and it is better than a patch that quietly works around it.
